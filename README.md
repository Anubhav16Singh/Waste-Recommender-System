## 📸 How It Works

1. **Upload**  
   The user uploads an image of a waste item using the web interface.

2. **Prediction**  
   The backend processes the image using the CNN model and classifies it into one of the 12 categories.

3. **Web Scraping**  
   Based on the predicted category, the system fetches relevant reuse or recycling ideas from reliable sources on the internet.

4. **Display**  
   The system presents the user with ideas and tips on how to dispose of the waste in a sustainable and eco-friendly manner.
