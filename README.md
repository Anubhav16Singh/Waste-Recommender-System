# ‚ôªÔ∏è Waste Recommender System

This project is a smart Waste Recommender System that helps users classify their waste and discover eco-friendly ways to reuse or recycle it. Powered by a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and web scraping techniques, it encourages sustainable waste management through technology.

## üöÄ Features

- **Image Upload Interface**: Users can upload an image of waste through a user-friendly UI.
- **CNN-based Waste Classification**: The uploaded image is processed using a trained Convolutional Neural Network to classify it into one of the predefined waste categories (e.g., plastic, metal, glass, paper, etc.).
- **Web Scraping for Reuse Ideas**: Based on the predicted waste category, the system fetches reuse/recycling ideas from the web in real-time to guide users on sustainable waste disposal.

## üß† Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (optional frameworks for UI enhancement)
- **Backend**: Python (Flask / FastAPI)
- **Model**: Custom CNN (trained on 12 waste categories)
- **Libraries**:
  - `TensorFlow` / `Keras` (for CNN)
  - `BeautifulSoup` or `Scrapy` (for web scraping)
  - `Pillow`, `NumPy`, `OpenCV` (for image preprocessing)
  - `Requests` (to fetch web content)

## üóÇÔ∏è Waste Categories

The system is trained to recognize the following 12 waste categories:

1. Plastic
2. Metal
3. Glass
4. Paper
5. Cardboard
6. Textile
7. Wood
8. Organic
9. E-waste
10. Rubber
11. Construction debris
12. Others

## üì∏ How It Works

1. **Upload**: Click the "Upload Image" button and select a picture of the waste item.
2. **Predict**: The CNN model classifies the image into the appropriate waste category.
3. **Recommend**: Based on the category, the system scrapes the web for relevant reuse or recycling ideas.
4. **Display**: Recommendations are displayed to the user to encourage environmentally friendly disposal.
